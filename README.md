# Info
This repository will hold the info gathered during the WordPress Core GDPR journey. It will be transferred to approriate other places when in a more finalised state.
## Goals
The following goals are identified:
1. Identify all personal data stored by core processes.
1. Add tools (functions,hooks,etc.) in core to facilitate compliance, and privacy in general:

   * For Administrators/site owners to get an overview of what data is stored and how to use the tools
   * To anonymise/delete personal data
   * To show/export personal data (for transfer)
   * Add notices for both registered users and commenters on what data is collected in core by default, and why.
  
1. Create some guidelines for plugins on how to use the core tools.
