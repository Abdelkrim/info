## What is Personal Data in Core
The following data has to be considered for anonymising, deleting, etc:
1. For Users

   * User Login
   * User Pass
   * User Nicename
   * User Display Name
   * User Email
   * User URL
   
1. For Comments

   * Author name
   * Author email
   * Author IP
   * Author URL
   * Author user agent
 
 What is NOT considered to be anonymised (so only the above parts are needed):
 * Posts/comments : Once a user is anynomised, the post/comment cannot be linked to the user anymore so should not be further anonymised.
